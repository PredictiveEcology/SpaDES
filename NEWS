Known issues: https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES/issues

version 1.3.1.9000
==================
* minimum R version increased from `3.2.2` to `3.3.0` as required by dependency `RandomFieldsUtils`.
* modules are now run with their required packages (reqdPkgs in metadata) temporarily bumped to the top of the search path (i.e., `search()`) during each event. `search()` path is restored `on.exit` from `spades` or `simInit` call
* add Rcpp-based internal functions for speed, added to imports
* `downloadModule` checks for and uses environment variable `GITHUB_PAT` if it exists (alleviates 403 download errors caused by GitHub download limits)
* `shine` can now take characters in parameters
* change order of parsing of modules: `defineModule` is last, so can use objects defined within module for parameters
* improved `simInit` debug mechanism -- passing character string of module name will enter into a `browser` call inside `doEvent`
* improvements to caching:

    * improved caching for `Raster*` objects & S4 methods - now it normally persists across sessions;
    * add `Cache` (upper case) which derives cacheRepo arg automatically from either the cachePath(sim), if used within a module, or getPath()$cachePath if not within a module. Also, the upper case removes the name conflict with `archivist::cache`;
    * add caching mechanisms at the module-level and event-level (via new *.useCache* parameter, which can be logical indicating whole module or character indicating individual events);
    * add caching for .inputObjects function in `simInit`, via .useCache parameter in module
    * detailed caching overview now in cache help: `?Cache` for details.
    * strips dirname for outputs and inputs, i.e., only keeps basename. This may not be stringent enough in some cases.

* improved documentation
* new function `getPaths()` to return the list of working dirs from the options
* new function `setPaths()` as wrapper for setting the options for working dirs; uses `~/SpaDES` as default base path
* import `fastmatch`, and add `%fin%` as replacement for `%in%`
* implemented `checkModuleLocal()` to check for presence of module files in the module dir before attempting download from remote module repository
* `distanceFromEachPoint`: uses faster Rcpp code for some use cases & can now take arbitrary columns in either `from` or `to` arguments
* some performance improvements throughout (minimizing use of simList accessors where possible)
* workaround issues with RStudio graphics on Linux (with #116): use `dev.noRSGD()` to bypass the Rstudio graphics device for your current session (sets the `device` option for your platform).
* event queues (event, completed, current) now do shallow copies of pre-existing data.tables, rather than `rblindlist( )`. This improved DES speed by > 40%. Benchmarking of 1400 events in 1.6 seconds now; previously 3.0 seconds.
* add `Copy` (capital C) as replacement for `copy` which conflicts with `data.table::copy`, and add `queues` argument to do a deep copy of the event queues.
* spread function: minor speedups, plus 3 new parameters `relativeSpreadProb`, `numNeighs` & `exactSizes`
* spread2 function: new function that is more robust than spread, slightly slower under some situations, but faster in many others. The function is designed to be used as a building block for more complex spreading, where the user can wrap spread2 inside a custom function that iteratively calls spread2, while optionally changing any of the input arguments.
* adj - has a new argument returnDT, which slightly improves speed in cases where the user wants the output to become a data.table. This simply prevents a call to as.matrix() in the return(), which was occurring if the return value was a data.table.
* new function `copyModule` for creating a copy of an existing module
* change default value for `speedup` in `gaussMap`; now 1.
* improve module template to auto fill module author info using `devtools.desc.author` option if set.
* `zipModule` now has `data` argument, allowing data to be omitted from zipped module.
* improved `moduleDiagram` to show `_INPUT_` node in different colour from the other modules
* `checksums(..., write = TRUE)` ignores the contents of `CHECKSUMS.txt`, overwriting that file with the checksums of all files in the module's `data/` directory. This makes it easier to update the checksum file, *e.g.*, when adding new data (#332).
* improved module versioning (#321)
* minor bugfixes for unusual cases
* imports bit package
* removed stringr package from imports

* **Defunct**:

    * `p`. Use `params` or `P` instead.
    * `versionWarning`. Wasn't used.

version 1.3.1
=============
* Default module path (set via `spades.modulePath` option) is now set to a temporary location to avoid unintentionally writing to the user's home directory.
* add options for cache, input, output dirs (defaults to a temp dir until changed by user)
* rename `spades.modulesPath` and `spades.modulesRepo` options to `spades.modulePath` and `spades.moduleRepo`
* New cache-related functions: `showCache` and `clearCache`

version 1.3.0
=============
* stricter package version dependencies in Imports and Suggests
* `debug` argument in `spades()` can now take any expression, character strings. `TRUE`/`FALSE` changed behavior to show only current event.
* timeunits: when there are parent and grandparent modules, if timeunit is defined, it overrides the "smallest unit" rule. Thus, a parent module can force a timeunit.
* Plot - enhancements and fixes:

    * more robust base plotting and many visual tests on Windows;
    * re-add `col` arg to `Plot` (mimicks `cols`). Was lost from version 1.1.2;
    * allow any arbitrary function to be used internally to `Plot` (*e.g.*, barplot, plot, etc.);
    * add `arr` argument to `Plot()`, allowing passing of arrangement;
    * allow `title` arg in `Plot()` to accept character for plot title;
    * `Plot` can use character passed to `title` as a title;
    * some additional functionality for plotting of factor rasters, incl. `clickValues`, legends correct for wide variety of types;
    * change `new` arg in `Plot()`. Now it does one plot at a time, not whole device. Use `clearPlot()` to wipe whole device.

* Add `modulesGraph`, showing parent and child module relationships.
* Add `filesOnly` arg to `shine()`. This can be in preparation for publishing to www.shinyapps.io or other pages. Currently still alpha.
* Add POM: Pattern Oriented Modeling (#269). A simple interface to a simList object, allowing fitting parameters to data.
* add `.inputObjects` functionality -- function that runs during `simInit()` to create default `inputObjects`
* add `P` as a namespaced shortcut for params: `P(sim)` would replace `params(sim)$moduleName` when called from within that module
* allow `params(sim)` & `start(sim)` & others in `defineModule()` by changing parse order in module metadata
* add explicit `cl` arg to parallel aware functions, for more control
* `newModule` gains new arguments `type = c("child", "parent")` and `children = c()`. See `?newModule` (#300).
* module structure now includes an R subfolder for R scripts. These will be parsed during simInit.
* `checksums` updated to use faster hashing algorithm (`xxhash64`) and now only requires a single hash value per file (#295)
* new RStudio addin for 'newModule' (#298); requires Import of `shiny (>= 0.13)`, `miniUI (>= 0.1.1)`, and `rstudioapi (>= 0.5)`
* fixed bugs in module template
* fixed bug in `cir` (#288, #311)
* improved use of package options; added new option `spades.modulesPath`.
* improved `downloadModule` to use option `spades.modulesPath` (#309)

* new function `rings` whose argument names closer match to `cir`
* performance enhancements in `spread`, `rings`, `cir`
* add cache and progress args to spades and experiment functions
* `Plot` now clips symbols (generally points) to plotting area. This will allow future "wiping" of plot area.
* `dev()` returns `dev.cur` invisibly, allowing for finer control of plotting devices
* add `distanceFromEachPoint`, a multipoint version of `raster::distanceFromPoints`
* improve `splitRaster` (#276, #284)
* new function `mergeRaster` (#282, #283)

version 1.0.1
=============
* no longer `attach` the simulation environment (#212)
* improve documentation
* bug fixes

version 1.0.0
=============
* no longer rely on side effects to update objects in global environment; instead uses simulation environments (#185) (not backwards compatible!)
* sample modules rewritten to use simulation enviroments (#185) (not backwards compatible!).
* redefined `simList` class:

    - new superclass `.simList` contains all previous `simList` slots except `.envir`
    - class `simList` extends `.simList` by adding slot `.envir`
    - new class `simList_` extends `.simList` by adding slot `.list`
    - `simList_` can be used internally to save a `simList` object,
    because saving lists of objects to file is more reliable that saving environments.

* simulations now use `timeunit` (instead of `timestep`) specified in metadata (#151)
* `defineModule` requires `timeunit` to be a character string instead of numeric (with #151)
* simulation checkpointing fixed (#191, #130)
* `ls` and `ls.str` can now be used with `simList` objects to list objects in the simulation environment
* `objs` returns a list containing all the objects in the simulation enviroment
