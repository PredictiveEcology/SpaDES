Known issues: https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/SpaDES/issues

version 1.0.0
=============
* no longer rely on side effects to update objects in global environment; instead uses simulation environments (#185) (not backwards compatible!)
* sample modules rewritten to use simulation enviroments (#185) (not backwards compatible!).
* redefined `simList` class:

    - new superclass `.simList` contains all previous `simList` slots except `.envir`
    - class `simList` extends `.simList` by adding slot `.envir`
    - new class `simList_` extends `.simList` by adding slot `.list`
    - `simList_` can be used internally to save a `simList` object,
    because saving lists of objects to file is more reliable that saving environments.

* `fastshp` can be installed from Rforge as a CRAN-like repository (instead of relying on `devtools::install_github`)
* software requirements changed: depends R (>=3.2.0)
* moved `data.table`, `grid`, `raster`, and `sp` from Depends to Imports (#207).
* add `archivist`, `ff`, `ffbase` to Imports;  add `lubridate` to Imports (with #151)
* removed `magrittr` from Imports (`%>%` is now exported by `igraph`)
* most external methods/classes imported using `importFrom`; except `methods`, `graphics`, and `igraph` (because of classes which are not exported from igraph) (#201)
* simulations now use `timeunit` (instead of `timestep`) specified in metadata (#151)
* `defineModule` requires `timeunit` to be a character string instead of numeric (with #151)
* simulation checkpointing fixed (#191, #130)
* `ls` and `ls.str` can now be used with `simList` objects to list objects in the simulation environment
* `objs` returns a list containing all the objects in the simulation enviroment
* new function `splitRaster` to divide `RasterLayer` into several tiles
* new function `normPath` (extracted from `checkPath`) to more strictly normalize filepaths without checking that they exist.
* new function `classFilter` to filter list of objects by their type
* new function `packages` to get all packages required by a simulation
* new function `rndstr` to generate random strings
* new function `append_attr` to append list items and keep their attributes
* improved `loadPackages`
* improved `.objectNames`
* `defineParameter` now accepts `min`, `max`, and description values (#172; #175)
* `defineModule` better handles `NA` values (#138)
* various `Plot` improvements.
* new plotting funcions to produce overview diagrams of simulations (#181; #184):

    - `eventDiagram` shows Gantt chart of event sequences
    - `moduleDiagram` shows igraph network diagram of dependencies
    - `objectDiagram` shows sequence diagram of object dependencies between modules

* improved `simList` show and debug methods (#57; #73)
* improvements to `loadFiles`:

    - use `data.table`
    - allow `package::function` notation in load (#174)
    - bug fixes

* added "metamodules" which specify module groups (#176)
* improved test coverage (see #139)
* all functions imported explicity (@importFrom). 3 entire packages imported: methods, graphics, igraph (because of classes which are not exported from igraph) (#201)
* removed package dependencies on raster, sp, data.table, grid. Use importFrom instead (#207).
* improved documentation and vignettes
* added cache mechanism to hash function calls to spades (#206)
* fixed progress bar bug (#147)
* prepend copyright info to `LICENSE` and `README` (with #140)
* various other bug fixes

version 0.6.2
=============
This is a minor release update to satisfy CRAN submission requirements.

* bug fix when saving files

version 0.6.1
=============
* added the Queen as copyright holder (#140)
* explicitly use GPL-3 (previously used GPL) (#140)
* modules now require metadata; module code without it will break!

    - new module dependency checking and metadata structure (#126)
    - explicit declaration of parameters, and object (data) dependencies
    - deprecated use of `reloadModuleLater`

* new module directory structure (#125):

        moduleName/
        |_ moduleName.R    # the actual module code file, incl. module metadata
        |_ moduleName.Rmd  # longform documentation and usage info, etc.
        |_ citation.bib    # properly formatted bibtex citation for the module
        |_ LICENSE         # license file describing the allowed usage etc. of the module
        |_ README          # incl. module metadata in addition to version change info, etc.

* updated package dependencies:
    * added `downloader`, `dplyr`, `fpCompare`, `httr`, `magrittr`, `stringr` to `Imports`
* updated vignettes and documentation improvements
* transfered project to `PredictiveEcology/SpaDES` from `achubaty/SpaDES`.
* overhaul to `Plot` function:
    * no longer needs `*Named` objects.
    * now handles `SpatialPolygons` objects much faster than default `plot`:
        * Uses package `fastshp`.
            * The suggested package `fastshp` can be installed with:

                    install_github("s-u/fastshp")

    * numerous other `Plot` improvements
* deprecated all `*Named` functionality
    * All code will break that uses `*Named` objects
* new function, `clearPlot` can be used to clean all hidden metadata about a plot
* new function, `randomPolygons`, will create random raster maps (not vector maps) of polygons
* numerous bugfixes

version 0.4.0
=============
* second public ("beta") release
* more improvements to Plot function, including dramatically faster for files on disk
* added second "Model" that adds and integrates 3 sample modules, Fire, Succession and Aging
* added Plotting vignette
* bugfixes

version 0.3.1
=============

* first public ("beta") release
* reworked plotting and visualization (it's faster, more reliable)
* added additional parameter checks and improved debugging
* new and improved documentation:
    - two new vignettes (introduction to SpaDES and how modules work)
    - new demo highlighting visualization components
    - more complete code documentation
* numerous bug fixes

version 0.2
=============

* renamed package to SpaDES

version 0.1
=============

* first working alpha version
* lots of "wishlist" items still to be implemented
