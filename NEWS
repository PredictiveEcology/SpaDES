version 1.0.1
=============
* no longer `attach` the simulation environment (#212)
* improve documentation
* bug fixes

version 1.0.0
=============
* no longer rely on side effects to update objects in global environment; instead uses simulation environments (#185) (not backwards compatible!)
* sample modules rewritten to use simulation enviroments (#185) (not backwards compatible!).
* redefined `simList` class:

    - new superclass `.simList` contains all previous `simList` slots except `.envir`
    - class `simList` extends `.simList` by adding slot `.envir`
    - new class `simList_` extends `.simList` by adding slot `.list`
    - `simList_` can be used internally to save a `simList` object,
    because saving lists of objects to file is more reliable that saving environments.

* `fastshp` can be installed from Rforge as a CRAN-like repository (instead of relying on `devtools::install_github`)
* software requirements changed: depends R (>=3.2.0)
* moved `data.table`, `grid`, `raster`, and `sp` from Depends to Imports (#207).
* add `archivist`, `ff`, `ffbase` to Imports;  add `lubridate` to Imports (with #151)
* removed `magrittr` from Imports (`%>%` is now exported by `igraph`)
* most external methods/classes imported using `importFrom`; except `methods`, `graphics`, `igraph`, and `utils` (because of methods/classes which are not exported) (#201)
* simulations now use `timeunit` (instead of `timestep`) specified in metadata (#151)
* `defineModule` requires `timeunit` to be a character string instead of numeric (with #151)
* simulation checkpointing fixed (#191, #130)
* `ls` and `ls.str` can now be used with `simList` objects to list objects in the simulation environment
* `objs` returns a list containing all the objects in the simulation enviroment
* new function `splitRaster` to divide `RasterLayer` into several tiles
* new function `normPath` (extracted from `checkPath`) to more strictly normalize filepaths without checking that they exist.
* new function `classFilter` to filter list of objects by their type
* new function `packages` to get all packages required by a simulation
* new function `rndstr` to generate random strings
* new function `append_attr` to append list items and keep their attributes

    - bug fixes

* added "metamodules" which specify module groups (#176)

* bug fix when saving files

version 0.6.1
=============
* added the Queen as copyright holder (#140)
* explicitly use GPL-3 (previously used GPL) (#140)
* modules now require metadata; module code without it will break!

    - new module dependency checking and metadata structure (#126)
    - explicit declaration of parameters, and object (data) dependencies
    - deprecated use of `reloadModuleLater`

* new module directory structure (#125):

        moduleName/
        |_ moduleName.R    # the actual module code file, incl. module metadata
        |_ moduleName.Rmd  # longform documentation and usage info, etc.
        |_ citation.bib    # properly formatted bibtex citation for the module
        |_ LICENSE         # license file describing the allowed usage etc. of the module
        |_ README          # incl. module metadata in addition to version change info, etc.

* updated vignettes and documentation improvements
* transfered project to `PredictiveEcology/SpaDES` from `achubaty/SpaDES`.
* overhaul to `Plot` function:
    * no longer needs `*Named` objects.
    * now handles `SpatialPolygons` objects much faster than default `plot`:
        * Uses package `fastshp`.
            * The suggested package `fastshp` can be installed with:

                    install_github("s-u/fastshp")

    * numerous other `Plot` improvements
* deprecated all `*Named` functionality
    * All code will break that uses `*Named` objects
