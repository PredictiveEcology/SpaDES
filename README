# Spatial Discrete Event Simulation (SpaDES)

*A package to develop and run spatially explicit discrete event simulation models.*

Implement a variety of simulation models, with a focus on spatially explicit raster models and agent based models. The core simulation components are built upon a discrete event simulation framework that facilitates modularity, and enables the user to include additional functionality by running user-built simulation modules. Included are numerous tools to visualize raster and other maps.

## Installation

To install a prebuilt `SpaDES` binary (.zip file) or source file, go to: [Version 0.4.0 zip](https://github.com/achubaty/SpaDES/raw/master/SpaDES_0.4.0.zip) or [Version 0.4.0 tar.gz](https://github.com/achubaty/SpaDES/raw/master/SpaDES_0.4.0.tar.gz).

To install `SpaDES` directly from github you will need the `devtools` package:

    install.packages("devtools")
    library("devtools")
	
    install_github("achubaty/SpaDES")

**NOTE:** you may get errors relating to not having installed the software tools requried for building R packages on your system:

1. For development purposes on a Windows machine, you'll need to install [Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/);
2. In order to build the vignettes from source (which is done when installing a package from GitHub) you need to have a LaTeX distribution installed. I recommend [TexLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/).
3. Our testing with the `raster` package, version 2.3, causes plotting to fail (using both `plot` and `Plot` functions). Please use `raster` package version 2.2-31.

If the install from GitHub fails during vignette building, you can skip this step (and avoid having to install LaTeX) by using `install_github("achubaty/SpaDES", build=FALSE)`. You can access prebuilt versions of the vignettes from here: [intro](https://github.com/achubaty/SpaDES/blob/master/vignettes/introduction.pdf?raw=true) and [modules](https://github.com/achubaty/SpaDES/blob/master/vignettes/modules.pdf?raw=true).

These won't be issues once the package is available via CRAN.
