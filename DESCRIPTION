Title: A package to develop and run spatially explicit discrete event
    simulation models
Description: Easily implement a variety of simulation models, with a focus on
    spatially explicit agent based models. The core simulation components are
    built upon a discrete event simulation framework that facilitates
    modularity, and easily enables the user to include additional functionality
    by running user-built simulation modules. Included are numerous tools to
    visualize raster and other maps.
