\arguments{
\item{patches}{\code{RasterLayer} of patches, with some sort of a patch id.}

\item{numPerPatchTable}{A \code{data.frame} or \code{data.table} with a
column named \code{pops} that matches the \code{patches} patch ids}

\item{numPerPatchMap}{A \code{RasterLayer} exactly the same as \code{patches}
but with agent numbers rather than ids as the cell values per patch.}
}
\value{
A raster with 0s and 1s, where the 1s indicate starting locations of
agents following the numbers above.
