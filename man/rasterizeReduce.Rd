\title{Convert reduced representation to full raster}
\usage{
rasterizeReduced(reduced, fullRaster, newRasterCols,
  mapcode = names(fullRaster), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{reduced}{\code{data.frame} or \code{data.table} that has at least one
column of codes that are represented in the \code{fullRaster}.}

\item{fullRaster}{\code{RasterLayer} of codes used in \code{reduced} that represents
a spatial representation of the data}

\item{newRasterCols}{Character vector, length 1 or more, with the name(s) of the column(s) 
in \code{reduced} whose value will be returned as a Raster or list of 
Rasters}

\item{mapcode}{a character, length 1, with the name of the column in \code{reduced} that
is represented in \code{fullRaster}}

\item{...}{Other arguments. None used yet.}
}
\value{
A \code{RasterLayer} or list of \code{RasterLayer} of with same 
dimensions as \code{fullRaster} representing
\code{newRasterCols} spatially, according to the join between the \code{mapcode} contained within
\code{reduced} and \code{fullRaster}
}

library(data.table)

Ras <- raster(extent(0,15,0,15), res=1)

# The default key is the layer name of the fullRas, so even
# if the reducedDT is miskeyed
