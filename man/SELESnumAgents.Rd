\item{probInit}{Probability of initalizing an agent at the location.}
}
\value{

\description{
Sets the the number of agents to initiate. THIS IS NOT YET FULLY IMPLEMENTED.

A \code{SELES}-like function to maintain conceptual backwards compatability
with that simulation tool. This is intended to ease transitions from
\href{http://www.gowlland.ca/}{SELES}.

You must know how to use SELES for these to be useful.
