}
\arguments{
\item{landscape}{A \code{RasterLayer} object. This defines the possible locations
for spreading events to start and spread into. This can also
be used as part of \code{stopRule}. Require input.}

\item{loci}{A vector of locations in \code{landscape}. These should be cell indexes.
If user has x and y coordinates, these can be converted with
\code{\link[raster]{cellFromXY}}.}

\item{spreadProb}{Numeric or rasterLayer.  The overall probability of
spreading, or probability raster driven. Default is \code{0.23}.
If a \code{spreadProbLater} is provided, then this is
only used for the first iteration. Also called Escape
probability. See section on \code{Breaking out of spread events}.}

\item{persistence}{A length 1 probability that an active cell will continue to burn,
per time step.}

\item{mask}{non-NULL, a \code{RasterLayer} object congruent with
\code{landscape} whose elements are \code{0,1},
where 1 indicates "cannot spread to".
Currently not implemented, but identical behavior can be
achieved if \code{spreadProb} has zeros in all unspreadable
locations.}

\item{maxSize}{Numeric. Maximum number of cells for a single or
all events to be spread. Recycled to match \code{loci} length,
if it is not as long as \code{loci}.
See section on \code{Breaking out of spread events}.}

\item{directions}{The number adjacent cells in which to look;
default is 8 (Queen case). Can only be 4 or 8.}

\item{iterations}{Number of iterations to spread.
Leaving this \code{NULL} allows the spread to continue
until stops spreading itself (i.e., exhausts itself).}

\item{lowMemory}{Logical. If true, then function uses package \code{ff}
internally. This is slower, but much lower memory footprint.}

\item{returnIndices}{Logical. Should the function return a data.table with
indices and values of successful spread events, or
return a raster with values. See Details.}

\item{returnDistances}{Logical. Should the function inclue a column with the
individual cell distances from the locus where that event
started. Default is FALSE. See Details.}

\item{mapID}{Deprecated use id}

\item{id}{Logical. If TRUE, returns a raster of events ids.
If FALSE, returns a raster of iteration numbers,
i.e., the spread history of one or more events. NOTE:
this is overridden if \code{returnIndices} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{plot.it}{If TRUE, then plot the raster at every iteraction,
so one can watch the spread event grow.}

\item{spreadProbLater}{Numeric or rasterLayer. If provided, then this
will become the spreadProb after the first iteration. See details.}

\item{spreadState}{Data.table. This should be the output of a previous call to
\code{spread}, where \code{returnIndices} was \code{TRUE}. Default NA,
meaning the spread is starting from \code{loci}. See Details.}

\item{circle}{Logical. If TRUE, then outward spread will be by equidistant rings,
rather than solely by adjacent cells (via \code{directions} arg.). Default
is FALSE. Using \code{circle=TRUE} can be dramatically slower for large
problems. Note, this should usually be used with spreadProb = 1.}

\item{circleMaxRadius}{Numeric. A further way to stop the outward spread of events. If
\code{circle} is \code{TRUE}, then it will grow to this maximum radius.
See section on
\code{Breaking out of spread events}. Default to NA.}

\item{stopRule}{A function which will be used to assess whether each individual cluster
should stop growing. This function can be an argument of "landscape",
"id", "cells", and
any other named vectors, a named list of named vectors,
or a named data.frame of with column names passed to spread in
the ... . Default NA meaning that
spreading will not stop as a function of the landscape. See section on
\code{Breaking out of spread events} and examples.}

\item{stopRuleBehavior}{Character. Can be one of "includePixel", "excludePixel", "includeRing",
"excludeRing". If \code{stopRule} contains a function, this argument is
used determine what to do with the cell(s) that caused the rule to be
\code{TRUE}. See details. Default is "includeRing" which means to
accept the entire ring of cells that caused the rule to be \code{TRUE}.}

\item{allowOverlap}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then individual events can overlap with one
another, i.e., they do not interact. Currently, this is slower than
if \code{allowOverlap} is \code{FALSE}. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{asymmetry}{A numeric indicating the ratio of the asymmetry to be used. Default is
NA, indicating no asymmetry. See details. This is still experimental.
Use with caution.}

\item{asymmetryAngle}{A numeric indicating the angle in degrees (0 is "up", as in North on a map),
that describes which way the \code{asymmetry} is.}

\item{...}{Additional named vectors or named list of named vectors
required for \code{stopRule}. These
vectors should be as long as required e.g., length
\code{loci} if there is one value per event.}
}
\value{
Either a \code{RasterLayer} indicating the spread of the process in
the landscape or a \code{data.table} if \code{returnIndices} is \code{TRUE}.
If a \code{RasterLayer}, then it represents
every cell in which a successful spread event occurred. For the case of, say, a fire
this would represent every cell that burned. If \code{allowOverlap} is \code{TRUE},
This Raster layer will represent the sum of the individual event ids (which
are numerics \code{seq_along(loci)}. This will
generally be of minimal use because it won't be possible to distinguish if
event 2 overlapped with event 5 or if it was just event 7.

If \code{returnIndices} is \code{TRUE},
then this function returns a \code{data.table} with columns:

\tabular{ll}{
  \code{id} \tab an arbitrary ID \code{1:length(loci)} identifying
                     unique clusters of spread events, i.e., all cells
                     that have been spread into that have a
                     common initial cell.\cr
  \code{initialLocus} \tab the initial cell number of that particular
                           spread event.\cr
  \code{indices} \tab The cell indices of cells that have
                       been touched by the spread algorithm.\cr
  \code{active} \tab a logical indicating whether the cell is active (i.e.,
                       could still be a source for spreading) or not (no
                       spreading will occur from these cells).\cr
}

This will generally be more useful when \code{allowOverlap} is \code{TRUE}.
}
\description{
This can be used to simulate fires, seed dispersal, calculation of iterative,
concentric landscape values (symmetric or asymmetric) and many other things.
Essentially, it starts from a collection of cells (\code{loci}) and spreads
to neighbours, according to the \code{directions} and \code{spreadProbLater} arguments.
This can become quite general, if \code{spreadProbLater} is 1 as it will expand
from every loci until all cells in the landscape have been covered.
With \code{id} set to \code{TRUE}, the resulting map will be classified
by the index of the cell where that event propagated from.
This can be used to examine things like fire size distributions.
}
\details{
For large rasters, a combination of \code{lowMemory = TRUE} and
\code{returnIndices = TRUE} will use the least amount of memory.

This function can be interrupted before all active cells are exhausted if
the \code{iterations} value is reached before there are no more active
cells to spread into. If this is desired, \code{returnIndices} should be
\code{TRUE} and the output of this call can be passed subsequently as an input
to this same function. This is intended to be used for situations where external
events happen during a spread event, or where one or more arguments to the spread
function change before a spread event is completed. For example, if it is
desired that the \code{spreadProb} change before a spread event is completed because,
for example, a fire is spreading, and a new set of conditions arise due to
a change in weather.

\code{asymmetry} is currently used to modify the \code{spreadProb} in the following way.
First for each active cell, spreadProb is converted into a length 2 numeric of Low and High
spread probabilities for that cell:
\code{spreadProbsLH <- (spreadProb*2)/(asymmetry+1)*c(1,asymmetry)}, whose ratio is equal to
\code{asymmetry}. Then, using \code{asymmetryAngle}, the angle between the
initial starting point of the event and all potential
cells is found. These are converted into a proportion of the angle from
\code{-asymmetryAngle} to \code{asymmetryAngle} using:
\code{angleQuality <- (cos(angles - rad(asymmetryAngle))+1)/2}

These are then converted to multiple spreadProbs by
\code{spreadProbs <- lowSpreadProb+(angleQuality * diff(spreadProbsLH))}
To maintain an expected \code{spreadProb} that is the same as the asymmetric
\code{spreadProbs}, these are then rescaled so that the mean of the
asymmetric spreadProbs is always equal to spreadProb at every iteration:
\code{spreadProbs <- spreadProbs - diff(c(spreadProb,mean(spreadProbs)))}
}
\section{Breaking out of spread events}{


There are 4 ways for the spread to "stop" spreading. Here, each "event" is defined as
all cells that are spawned from a single starting loci. So, one spread call can have
multiple spreading "events". The ways outlines below are all acting at all times,
i.e., they are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, it is the user's
responsibility to make sure the different rules are interacting with
each other correctly. Using \code{spreadProb} or \code{maxSize} are computationally
fastest, sometimes dramatically so.

\tabular{ll}{
  \code{spreadProb} \tab Probabilistically, if spreadProb is low enough,
                         active spreading events will stop. In practice,
                         active spreading events will stop. In practice,
                         this number generally should be below 0.3 to actually
                         see an event stop\cr
  \code{maxSize} \tab This is the number of cells that are "successfully" turned
                      on during a spreading event. This can be vectorized, one value
                      for each event   \cr
  \code{circleMaxRadius} \tab If \code{circle} is TRUE, then this will be the maximum
                      radius reached, and then the event will stop. This is
                      vectorized, and if length is >1, it will be matched
                      in the order of \code{loci}\cr
  \code{stopRule} \tab This is a function that can use "landscape", "id", "cells", or any
                      named vector passed into \code{spread} in the \code{...}. This
                      can take on relatively complex functions. Passing in, say, a Raster
                      Layer to \code{spread} can access the individual values on that
                      arbitrary Raster Layer using "cells". These will be calculated
                      within all the cells of the individual event (equivalent to a
                      "group_by(event)" in dplyr. So, \code{sum(arbitraryRaster[cells])}
                      would sum up all the raster values on the arbitraryRaster Raster
                      that are overlaid by the individual event. This can then be used in
                      a logical statement.  See examples.
                      To confirm the cause of stopping, the user can assess the values
                      after the function has finished.\cr
}

The spread function does not return the result of this stopRule. If,
say, an event has both \code{circleMaxRadius} and \code{stopRule},
and it is
the \code{circleMaxRadius} that caused the event spreading to stop,
there will be no indicator returned from this function that indicates
which rule caused the stop.

\code{stopRule} has many use cases. One common use case is evaluating
a neighbourhood around a focal set of points. This provides,
therefore, an alternative to the \code{\link[raster]{buffer}} function or
\code{\link[raster]{focal}} function.
In both of those cases, the window/buffer size must be an input to the function. Here,
the resulting size can be emergent based on the incremental growing and calculating
of the \code{landscape} values underlying the spreading event.
}

\section{\code{stopRuleBehavior}}{

This determines how the \code{stopRule} should be implemented. Because
spreading occurs outwards in concentric circles or shapes, one cell width at a time, there
are 4 possible ways to interpret the logical inequality defined in \code{stopRule}.
In order of number of cells included in resulting events, from most cells to fewest cells:

\tabular{ll}{
  \code{"includeRing"} \tab Will include the entire ring of cells that, as a group,
                            caused \code{stopRule} to be \code{TRUE}.\cr
  \code{"includePixel"} \tab Working backwards from the entire ring that caused the
                             \code{stopRule} to be \code{TRUE}, this will iteratively
                             random cells in the final ring
                             until the \code{stopRule} is \code{FALSE}. This will add back
                             the last removed cell and include it in the return result
                             for that event.\cr
  \code{"excludePixel"} \tab Like \code{"includePixel"}, but it will not add back the cell
                       that causes \code{stopRule} to be \code{TRUE}\cr
  \code{"excludeRing"} \tab Analogous to \code{"excludePixel"}, but for the entire final
                            ring of cells added. This will exclude the entire ring of cells
                            that caused the \code{stopRule} to be \code{TRUE}\cr
